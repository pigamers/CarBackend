I have made a full stack mern website for cars

it has 4 pages home, get car, sell car and about us. Login and singup page is different, forgot password page is also done
the funtioning is user signs up into the website if a user want to get a car he will go to the get a car page search for a particular car and from there the gets the details of the one who wants his car.
the thing is the person who wants to sell his car can also come the page signup and go to the sell a car page where he needs to fill up the form with basic details and after that he will submit.

voice speech is also enabled to navigate between pages and for search box in get a car page dark and light mode feature is also there.

see now the question is what else can I add to this project to make it a bigger one and for more details you can read all the files present in the project structure

These additions would make your project more comprehensive and production-ready. You can implement them gradually based on priority and complexity. Each feature would add value to both buyers and sellers, making the platform more useful and engaging.

Remember to:

Maintain proper error handling

Add proper documentation

Implement proper testing

Ensure scalability

Follow security best practices

Maintain consistent UI/UX

Add proper logging

Implement caching where necessary

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features or suggest more specific implementations?
